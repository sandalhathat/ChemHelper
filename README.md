# chemhelper

# this is going to be a side project that helps with junior level chemistry.

# eventually planning to deploy it as a web app

# planned usage: user can start typing in a formula, and perhaps at some point some suggestions will pop up, much like wolfram. 
# Also like wolfram, a single query will bring up most or any known information about the entered formula, including related
# formulas.
